# hi-kodprojesi
 This is a graduation project that my teammate and I developed for Kodluyoruz. Currently, it is a trial version that we plan to improve, as we created it in a very short period of time. The project is based on the theme of gender inequality, where a female hero battles against verbal abusers, also known as enemies.
 I worked with C# and on Unity.
